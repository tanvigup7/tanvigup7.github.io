      <h1>Hi, I'm Tanvi Gupta</h1>
  <p>
      I am currently an undergraduate student studying Computer Science with a passion for building systems that combine creativity and technology.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently working at <strong>ASPR AI</strong> and coauthoring a technical paper detailing the extensive process of LLM benchmarking to guide future model selection and strategy in sales.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time, I am building a <strong>Gesture-Based Music Controller</strong> that uses hand movements to control sound in real time.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m always looking to collaborate on innovative projects. Let's build something cool together!
